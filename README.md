# Mugraph Improvement Proposals

> [!WARNING]
> Please keep in mind that Mugraph is pre-alpha software, and has not been either audited nor it is feature-complete currently even for early adopters.
> Even if you for some reason decide to use it, do at your own risk.

This project tracks the specification for the Mugraph protocol through **Mugraph Improvement Proposals (MUIPs)**. Specifications present on this folder should guide the implementation itself.

## Implementations

Those are the projects that currently implement either part or the full specification:

- [ü¶Ä Mugraph](https://mugraph.dev): The reference implementation of the protocol.

If you are doing your own implementation, be free to add and update with details from your own implementation.

## Current Proposals

| ID | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| [0001](./muips/0001.md) | Basic Protocol Flow Definition | Define all the basic rules all participants in the network should follow, like transport and serialization. |

Status:

- ‚úÖ: This MUIP is fully supported on the implementation.
- ‚ùå: This MUIP is not supported on the implementation.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è : This MUIP is either partially implemented or misbehaves according to the spec.

## Compatibility Matrix

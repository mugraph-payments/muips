* [ ] Architecture
    - [ ] A network is called a Galaxy, and is made of N nodes.
    - [ ] Those N nodes collaborate to handle M hydra heads at once.
    - [ ] Users commit funds through incremental commits
    - [ ] Users decommit funds through incremental decommits
    - [ ] notes define origin head, but users could be paid/decommitted through any live head
    - [ ] heads could be geo-located for speed

## Introduction

Mugraph is not an application itself. Instead, it is a standard and protocol for developers to create applications and extensions on top of it.

## Architecture

TODO.
